RandomNumbers

Program draws random numbers by asking the user to give a lower bound and a
upper bound. Program checks that the upper bound is bigger than the lower
bound otherwise prints an error and program ends to a return value
EXIT_FAILURE.

After givin correct upper and lower bounds, program asks a seed value from
user and generates a random number with the given inputs. Program then asks
if the user wants to close the program. Program closes if q is given and
continues if any other key is given.
